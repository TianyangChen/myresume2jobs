# myresume2jobs

Tired of searching jobs? Or tired of hearing "Sorry, you are not a good fit"?

We are tring to improve the world of recruiting and/or jobseeking through the power A.I. 

In this project, once a user upload his resume, we will analysis his resume and compare with all job descriptions in our database, and recommend jobs that match his resume.

Currently, this is just a prototype developed during a hackthon. Out of 10 jobs, only 4 of them are relevant to your resume, which is not a graceful result.

If you are proficient in NLP (natural language processing) and interested in this project, please contact tenyo.chen@gmail.com.
